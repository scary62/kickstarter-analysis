## Overview of Project
Based on a previous analysis regarding crowdfunded campaigns for our client, Louise, we have been asked to use the previous data to uncover information regarding the outcomes of crowdsourced campaigns based on launch date and the goal amount of the campaign. The information from this analysis will assist the client in acheiving a successful Kickstarter campaign.

### Purpose
Our objective was to create two analysis based on Kickstarter data in order to assist our client in making decisions that positively impact their crowdfunding campaign. The first was to compare campaign outcomes to their launch date and the second was to compare outcomes by their funding goal.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
